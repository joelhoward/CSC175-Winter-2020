/*
The rules for pig latin are as follows:
a.	For words that begin with consonants, move the leading consonant to
 the end of the word and add "ay." Thus, "ball" becomes "allbay"; "button"
becomes "uttonbay"; and so forth.
b.	For words that begin with vowels, add "way" to the end.
Thus, “all” becomes “allway”;  “one” becomes “oneway”; and so forth.

    Purpose:            Convert a string to pig latin and output to screen
    Pre-condition:      We need to include the string library in our app,
                        and strInput needs to contain data.
    Post-condition:     We will now have a string converted to pig latin.
    Input:              (string) strInput - contains strings to be converted
                            to pig latin.
    Output:             To console, string that was converted to pig latin.
