File Paths:

	- Relative Path
		- a relative path is "realative" to the current working directory(ie: the directory your application is running from)
			/home/joelhowa/application.out - compiled application
			- input file:
				- input.txt - /home/joelhowa/input.txt
					- relative path: "input.txt" - relative to our current working directory
					- absolute path: "/home/joelhowa/input.txt" - full path on the file system
				- output.txt - /var/log/application.log
					- relative path: traverse out of directory with ".."
						"../application.log" - write the file to: /home/application.log
						"../../application.log" - write the file to: /application.log
						"../../var/log/application.log" - write the file to: /var/log/application.log
					- abosolute path:
						"/var/log/application.log"
	
	Special characters for navigating a file system
		- start with a "/" - this will always take you to to the root of the file system
		- start WITHOUT a "/" - this will always be realative of the directory where you executed the application(current working directory)
		- start with "../" - the ".." will allow you to traverse up a directory
